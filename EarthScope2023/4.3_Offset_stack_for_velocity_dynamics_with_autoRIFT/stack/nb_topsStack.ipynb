    "# Generating SLC stacks with topsStack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authors**: Bryan Riel\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will briefly demonstrate how to use `topsStack` to generate a stack of co-registered Sentinel-1 SLCs. The processing setup is identical to normal `topsApp.py` processing in that we download the appropriate SLC data, prepare a DEM for our study area, and download the necessary orbit and aux files from ASF/ESA (see previous tutorials on processing in TOPS mode with `topsApp.py`). More info on preparing for stacks can be found [here](https://github.com/parosen/Geo-SInC/tree/main/EarthScope2023/5.4_Intro_to_preparing_data_for_stack_processing).\n",

    "\n",
    "The following notebook has been run offline and is for demonstration purposes only. In order to run this notebook for your own data, you will need to download SLCs into an `asf` directory, place all orbits in an `orbits` directory, and all other auxiliary files in the `aux` directory. </i></b>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Study area and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, our study area is Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in West Antartica. PIG is a fast-flowing ice stream and is responsible for about 25% of the mass loss from Antarctica for the past few decades. Here, we will use Sentinel-1 A/B IW SLCs for path 65, frame 906 (ascending) for two dates: 2020-01-12 and 2020-01-18. Moreover, we will only use one swath (Swath 2), which contains most of the fast-flowing regions of PIG (see image in main dense offsets notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the digital elevation model (DEM), we will use the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) 100 meter mosaic, which can be accessed here (https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/). We warp the REMA data from Polar Stereographic South to WGS84 and apply a geoid correction in order to use for ISCE processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first import necessary Python packages."
